## Technologies Used

## Wireframes:

#### Site Map
- The site map visually outlines the structure of the website, showing the relationships between different pages and sections. It provides an overview of how users will navigate through the platform, ensuring an intuitive user experience.

#### Database Schema
- The database schema diagram illustrates the data model used in the application. It includes the tables, their relationships, and key fields, ensuring data integrity and efficient data management.

## MoSCoW Prioritization
- The MoSCoW method is used to prioritize features based on their importance and urgency. Features are categorized into Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have for the current version of the application.

## GitHub Projects, Milestones, and Issues

### GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects was used to manage and organize tasks. It provides a Kanban-style board that allows to visualize our workflow and track the progress of tasks.

### Milestones
Milestones are used to track the progress of significant phases in our project. Each milestone includes a set of issues that need to be completed to achieve the milestone goal.

### Issues
Issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for the project. Each issue is assigned to a team member and linked to a milestone.

For more details, visit the [GitHub Project]() page.


## Testing
All testing was done manually and automated using Django's built-in testing framework. The application was tested for functionality, user experience, and security. Test cases were created to cover user stories and edge cases, ensuring the application works as expected.
